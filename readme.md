#This is the ReadMe for Chase Hammock's and Erik Hansen's capstone project: RPG-Realm.

Live site can be found at www.rpg-realm.org.

Not all features on this git have made it to production.

Current Goals
______________________________________________________________________________________
1. add changing the passwords as an optional thing, not a required thing.
2. Set up a super user that can use functions that are not visible to the rest of the site.
   Use this to sidestep the need to bring pages up to the same standard as site before merging to master.
   Will need to bring CSS up to bring out of super user.
3. Implement Google maps.
4. Find/make a chat API.
